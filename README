Installation
============
First bootstrap the source tree:
./init.sh

The install using the standard:
./configure
make
make install

The ncurses, pthreads and parted libraries are required for compiling.
For any problems, please use the Github page:
https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe

If you wish to work & make changes to this code you may prefer to use
./configure --prefix=/usr CFLAGS='-O0 -g -Wall -Wextra' && make && make install

The '-O0 -g' flags disable optimisations, this is required if your debugging with
gdb in an IDE such as Kdevelop. Without these optimisations disabled you won't be
able to see the values of many variables in nwipe, not to mention the IDE won't step
through the code properly.

The -Wall & -Wextra flags enable all compiler warnings. Unfortunately as of 25/Sep/2018
there are quite a few warnings still present in nwipe. We're hoping to clear these warnings
(the proper way with a code review, rather than just casting without thinking),
but it would be nice to not have any more code added that generates warnings.
Most of these warnings are benign, however some do highlight bugs, e.g don't ignore
'variable is used before initialised'.

Once done with your coding then the released/patch/fixed code can be compiled with
./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
complete with all it's optimisations.
